## Notes

### UNIX

- This is all review, nevertheless, doesn't hurt to go over again
- `>` refers to using stdout to put to another file
- `>>` will append not overwrite
- `|` pipe just takes the output from another program into stdin, then runs the subsequent program
- [sort](./unix/sort.sh)
- [for](./unix/for.sh)
- [if](./unix/if.sh) https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html
- `du -sh *` gives disk usage for all files
